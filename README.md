# End of First Week
## 9/8/2017

This week we covered several things. We covered some basics on hardware, what an IP address is, how to connect to the class Ubuntu server using putty, how to edit directories and create files in a linux environment through putty, and the basics of using github.

Oh, we also learned how to connect the class Ubuntu server to github and now I can edit this file from either putty or github.com!

NEAT!

# End of Second Week
## 9/15/17

This week we started learning python3.
We did a simple "Hello World" program using the print() function.
Additionally, we added to this program by asking the user for their name, saying "Hello World, [input]".
I experimented with if and elif statements by myself during the course of the week as well.
Further, we experimented with various data types other than just strings, including int and float.
We learned how to concatenate strings and do basic mathematical operations in python3.
I learned how to cast different data types.

# End of Third Week
## 9/22/17

Throughout the week we learned things like string manipulation and mathematical functions.
Specifically, we learned how to cast variables so that a user's  input can be used in mathematical equations.
We learned how to add, subtract, multiply and divide int and float variables.
Further, we also learned how to use parentheses to influence order of operations.
We also called to the math class to use the square root function.
We also pulled apart and put together strings using the replace function as well as others.
All in all, it was a good week.
