# End of First Week
## 9/8/2017

This week we covered several things. We covered some basics on hardware, what an IP address is, how to connect to the class Ubuntu server using putty, how to edit directories and create files in a linux environment through putty, and the basics of using github.

Oh, we also learned how to connect the class Ubuntu server to github and now I can edit this file from either putty or github.com!

NEAT!

# End of Second Week
## 9/15/17

This week we started learning python3.
We did a simple "Hello World" program using the print() function.
Additionally, we added to this program by asking the user for their name, saying "Hello World, [input]".
I experimented with if and elif statements by myself during the course of the week as well.
Further, we experimented with various data types other than just strings, including int and float.
We learned how to concatenate strings and do basic mathematical operations in python3.
I learned how to cast different data types.

# End of Third Week
## 9/22/17

Throughout the week we learned things like string manipulation and mathematical functions.
Specifically, we learned how to cast variables so that a user's  input can be used in mathematical equations.
We learned how to add, subtract, multiply and divide int and float variables.
Further, we also learned how to use parentheses to influence order of operations.
We also called to the math class to use the square root function.
We also pulled apart and put together strings using the replace function as well as others.
All in all, it was a good week.

# End of Fourth Week
## 9/29/17

We experimented with flow control this week, learning the ins and outs of if statements.
Though I already know the concepts of flow control, I learned the specific calls to use within the Python language.
Further, I experimented (separately from the rest of the class) with the while loop.
As a class we learned how to utilize a nested if structure.
Using if statements, we created a very simple guessing game.
Within the game, if you guessed lower than the actual number, it would tell you you guessed too low, and similarly for if you guessed higher or if you guessed correctly.
We also created a simple login program where the user would 'log in' if they typed in the correct username and password combination.

# End of Seventh and Eighth Week
## 10/27/17

Last week we began working with loops.
We created several programs that looped several times with both the while and for structures.
Mr. Gold pushed on us that technically we now have all the tools necessary to make whatever we want with just the basics, loops, and if statements.
However, we will learn other useful things that make our programs cleaner and shorter, even though we can accomplish tasks without them.
We created a multiplication table and had the computer output both strong and armstrong numbers in some of our programs.
This week we worked on the homework due next Friday which all has to do with flow control, especially iteration.

# End of Ninth Week
## 11/3/17

Last week we were given homework based around iteration and general flow control.
We worked on this homework most of the week.
I had finished the majority of the homework last week, so Monday I spent helping Boas with problem 4.
I was drawing a blank on problem 5, so I put it off for the time being and I don't think I will finish it before it is due today.
That is okay though, because of the 5 problems we only had to complete 3 of them, while the other 2 were extra credit.
On Thursday we began exploring functions which we will delve further into next week.
Already being a programmer I am sufficiently aware of what functions are and how to use them, so I expect to be helping the other cadets figure them out in the coming week as this concept tends to be a little mind-boggling to those who have not been introduced to them before.
Overall, a good week.

# End of Nth Week
## 12/1/17

We began working with Raspberry Pi units this week.
After taking a few days to set them up, we began working with the Sense Hat add-ons.
The Sense Hat is a plug&play 8x8 pixel screen.
To program the screen, you must instantiate a SenseHat object in python, and use the set_pixels function to show colors on the screen.
The colors and lights of the screens are determined by lists that contain three values, corresponding to RGB values.
Afterwards, the input to the set_pixels function is a list of 64 of the RGB lists, each RGB list corresponding to a different pixel on the 8x8 screen on the sense hat.
Additionally, you can animate pictures you make with the sense hat by putting them in an infinite loop and using time.sleep in between set_pixels function calls, using each time you call to it as a different version of the picture effectively animating it.
Overall, this is a really fun project.

# End of Another Week
## 12/8/17

I made a lot of progress on my Tamagachi, but sadly, my code was lost two days ago.
I remember all of the logic behind having created the program, but I need to spend time recreating the animations from scratch.
Additionally, I am completely revising my idea for a Google Friday project.
I either want to create a 1v1 chess game or make a mini-game addon for my tamagachi.
The Tamagachi is a Pikachu, and I would have the player shoot lightning bolts at various incoming team rocket balloons.

# End of the Last Full Week Before Break!
## 12/15/17

Last week I lost my progress on the Tamagachi project and hadn't had a lot of time to catch up.
The tamagachi was initially going to be a pikachu, but I decided to go a different route now that I had a clean slate.
Now my tamagachi is the one they call Dovahkiin, Dragonborn!
Other than the design of the animations, the core of the program is almost complete.
I have an animation function, a while true loop to run through the program infinitely, and I have all of the flow control tools in place to control feeding and entertaining.
Concerning the logic of the program, all I need to add is the flow control around death and the happiness and hunger levels that will determine death.
When I add those two levels, I need to have them decrease slowly as the program continues to run, and I need them to be increased when fed and entertained.
Other than the logic explained above, I only need to then finish creating all the animations themselves.
